# Singly-LinkedList-implementation

I know that C++ provides vector class for this issues (Anyway I used STL vector class in toVector function to convert LinkedList to vector ) but I did this implementation for improve myself in C++ language. Functions in the LinkedList file written depend on Java Linkedlist functions  link here -> https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html. Even though I know that some functions have the same functionality , I still felt the need to write in order for the implementation to fit a certain pattern.
